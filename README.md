## System Architecture

The Chatbot System comprises two main components: the backend and the frontend.

**Backend**: The backend is built using Python and integrates various libraries and APIs for PDF processing, NLP tasks, and question-answering algorithms. It utilizes PyPDF2 for PDF text extraction, OpenAIEmbeddings for text embeddings, and Weaviate for efficient vector storage and retrieval. The backend script handles query processing, response generation, and manages the conversational context.

**Frontend**: The frontend is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, offering a visually appealing and user-friendly chat interface. It emulates the chat experience of popular messaging applications, providing an intuitive and engaging platform for users to interact with the chatbot. The frontend communicates with the backend through API calls, sending queries and receiving responses.

## Future Improvements

- **Enhanced Frontend**: Implement advanced features like message threading, message formatting, and customizable themes to enhance the user experience and make the chatbot interface more dynamic and visually appealing.
- **Advanced NLP Techniques**: Incorporate sentiment analysis and entity recognition to enable the chatbot to better understand and respond to user queries, improving the overall accuracy and contextual relevance of the responses.
- **Real-time Data Integration**: Integrate with external APIs or databases to fetch real-time data and provide up-to-date information to users, expanding the capabilities and usefulness of the chatbot.
- **Optimized Backend Processing**: Further optimize the backend processing pipeline to ensure faster response times, handle larger documents, and enhance scalability for increased user demand.
- **User Authentication and Personalization**: Implement user authentication and session management to personalize the chatbot experience for individual users, allowing for customized preferences and maintaining context across
